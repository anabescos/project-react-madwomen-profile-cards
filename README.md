# REACT MAD WOMEN PROFILE CARDS.

This project allows you to create your personal profile cards which include your contact data(phone number and email address) and links to your Linkedin and GitHub accounts. To do that you'll need to fill in all the required inputs. If you miss some, don't worry, you'll receive a notification saying which one you have missed.

You can create each card by choosing your own design(colors). And once the card is created you'll have an option to share it on Twitter, inviting people to contact you or to see your Linkedin and Github profiles.

We inherited this code from other colleagues who used Javascript to build this project. We were asked to refactor it by using React and we created a SPA (Single Page Application) which lands on a welcome page. From there you can go to the "card generator page", where you will be able to personalise your professional card, by adding all your personal information. 
Working with React allowed us to structure our code in components. To make the app more user-friendly, we storage the data locally, so if they come back without finishing or the website gets refreshed,the information will remain there.

We were also asked to create our own server, using Node JS, Express JS, SQLite and Heroku.

Using this [link](https://github.com/Adalab/project-promo-l-module-3-team-4.git) you can check out our code, explore it and play a little bit with it if you want. For that, you can clone/download the repository.

If you have any questions, please contact us, we'll be happy to help!
